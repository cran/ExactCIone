Description: Construct the admissible exact intervals for the binomial proportion, the Poisson mean and the total number of subjects with a certain attribute or the total number of the subjects for the hypergeometric distribution. Both one-sided and two-sided intervals are of interest. This package can be used to calculate the intervals constructed methods developed by Wang (2014) <doi:10.5705/ss.2012.257> and Wang (2015) <doi:10.1111/biom.12360>.
